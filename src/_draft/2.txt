This is a shockingly terrible computer.
Unbelievably slow!
The screen quality was awful.
My Chromebook has vastly superior color rendering, and the screen looks good at a wide range of viewing angles.
I closed everything but one web browser to compose an email, and I could not write simple text without the computer lagging behind.
It has an extremely narrow range of viewing angles.
Awkward feeling keyboard feel and layout too.
Iâ€™ve had several HP laptops.
Also, I played Solitaire, typed with Microsoft Word just fine.
First I was able to sign into my Microsoft account, receive the S Mode turn off switch, took an hour to set everything up, downloaded Chrome Browser along with the APP needed, I bought this basic HP Laptop because my PC was not Coded for APP, only Windows could work this particular APP.   
With the removal of S Mode.
