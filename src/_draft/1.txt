This is a shockingly terrible computer.
Unbelievably slow!
The screen quality was awful.
My Chromebook has vastly superior color rendering, and the screen looks good at a wide range of viewing angles.
I closed everything but one web browser to compose an email, and I could not write simple text without the computer lagging behind.
It has an extremely narrow range of viewing angles.
The look and feel is extremely cheap.
Awkward feeling keyboard feel and layout too.
It doesn’t keep time and day correctly.
I’ve had several HP laptops.
This is the first time I’ve had an issue with any HP product It was fine at first but then the issues started .
It doesn’t update correctly all the time it shuts off after a couple minutes, many tries for it to come back on.
I bought from a private seller on Amazon has many issues.
Also, I played Solitaire, typed with Microsoft Word just fine.
First I was able to sign into my Microsoft account, receive the S Mode turn off switch, took an hour to set everything up, downloaded Chrome Browser along with the APP needed, I bought this basic HP Laptop because my PC was not Coded for APP, only Windows could work this particular APP.   
With the removal of S Mode.
I knew with the RAM only at 4 that it would be half the speed to do tasks compared to what I am used to 8 RAM but it is not real noticeable, however, I do wait a little as expected, but no worries!
